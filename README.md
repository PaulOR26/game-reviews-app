# Game Reviews API

## Description

This project was to build a website using the API I had created in June to consolidated my understanding of making a C.R.U.D application from a front-end perspective.

The website contains game reviews and promotes social interaction through likes, comments and user selection. Each review has a specific URL allowing users to share them, and the site includes functionality for filtering and sorting reviews for ease of use.

The site is designed to provide a fluid browsing experience and allows users to continuously scroll through reviews, read information about them, like and comment, all without needing to navigate to different pages. This was made possible by using expandable components, and it encourages users to engage with the site for longer and provide more content.

I built the website using React and made use of react hooks to provide the functionality.
